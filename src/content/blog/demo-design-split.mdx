This is the **Split** layout. It divides the initial viewport into two equal halves: the feature image on the left, and the post details on the right.

## Modern Construction

This layout breaks away from the traditional "top-down" blog post structure. It feels more like a magazine spread or a digital feature.

### Vertical Flow

On mobile devices, this layout collapses gracefully into a standard vertical stack, ensuring that the experience stays consistent across all screen sizes.
