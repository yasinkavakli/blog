This is the **Split Reverse** layout. It is the mirror image of the standard split, placing the content on the left and the image on the right.

## Variation and Rhythm

Using alternating split layouts (some normal, some reverse) can create a pleasing rhythm when users are browsing through multiple featured posts. 

It highlights the content first, then the visual context.
