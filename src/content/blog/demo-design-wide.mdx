This post showcases the **Wide** layout. The hero image is significantly wider than the text container (approx 1200px), creating a cinematic effect while keeping the reading experience focused.

## Best of Both Worlds

This layout offers a compromise between the standard "Classic" view and the "Full" width view. It gives images room to breathe without completely taking over the user's screen real estate.

### Ideal Use Cases

*   Travel photography
*   Detailed diagrams that need width
*   Design case studies

The content itself remains in a comfortable 65ch width for optimal reading speed.
