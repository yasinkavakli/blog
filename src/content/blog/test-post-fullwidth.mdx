# Visual Storytelling at Scale

Sometimes, you need more space to tell a story. This post uses the `full-width` layout to showcase how wider content areas can be used effectively.

## Expansive Tables

| Feature | Default | Full Width |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Max Width** | `max-w-3xl` | `max-w-5xl` |
| **Usage** | Standard Articles | Case Studies, Galleries |
| **Impact** | Focused | Immersive |

## Code Snippets

```javascript
// This code block has more room to breathe
function calculateLayoutWidth(layout) {
    if (layout === 'full-width') {
        return 'max-w-5xl';
    }
    return 'max-w-3xl';
}
```

This layout is perfect for technical documentation, galleries (if we added a gallery component), or complex data visualizations.
