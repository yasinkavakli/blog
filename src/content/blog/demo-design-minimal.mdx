This post demonstrates the **Minimal** layout. Even though a `heroImage` is defined in the frontmatter, it is *not* displayed at the top of the post. This layout prioritizes typography and reading experience above all else.

## Focus on Content

In a world of constant visual stimulation, there is power in restraint. By removing the large header image, the reader's attention is immediately drawn to the title and the text.

### Typography Matters

Without the distraction of a hero image, the nuance of the typography takes center stage. The weight of the headings, the breathing room in the line height, and the contrast of the text against the background become the primary visual elements.
