This is an example of the **default layout**. It uses a constrained width (max-w-3xl) to ensure optimal line length for readability. This layout is ideal for standard blog posts, essays, and text-heavy content.

## Why Constrained Widths Matter

Reading long lines of text on a wide screen can be tiring for the eyes. By limiting the width of the content container, we make it easier for readers to track from the end of one line to the beginning of the next.

### Image Handling in Default Layout

Even in the default layout, images can look great.

They respect the container width, keeping everything aligned and tidy.

1.  **Readability**: Priority number one.
2.  **Focus**: No sidebars to distract.
3.  **Elegance**: Simple, centered content.
