This is an example of the **full-width layout**. It uses a wider container (max-w-5xl) to give more breathing room to visual content.

## When to Use Full Width

Use this layout when you have high-resolution images, code snippets that need horizontal space, or complex diagrams.

### Code Snippets

Wider layouts are also great for code blocks, preventing aggressive wrapping.

```javascript
function calculateOptimalWidth(viewportWidth) {
    if (viewportWidth > 1200) {
        return 'max-w-5xl'; // Give it space!
    }
    return 'max-w-3xl'; // Keep it readable.
}
```

The contrast and spacing remain consistent, but the canvas is larger.
