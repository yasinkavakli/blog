This post demonstrates the **Overlay** layout. It makes a bold statement by using a full-viewport height image as the background for the post title and metadata.

## Visual Impact

This design is perfect for feature stories or posts with high-quality photography. The text is positioned at the bottom-left, creating a strong hierarchy that prioritizes the visual hook first, closely followed by the headline.

### Readability Consideration

To ensure the white text remains readable against any image, a subtle gradient overlay is applied to the bottom of the hero section. This maintains accessibility without darkening the entire image.

All subsequent content is presented in a standard, readable column.
