This is the **Table of Contents (ToC)** layout. It is specifically designed for long-form technical writing, documentation, or detailed guides where navigation is key.

## Introduction

Unlike the other layouts that prioritize visual impact with large images, this layout focuses on structure. It features a sticky table of contents on the right side on larger screens, allowing readers to jump between sections effortlessly.

## The Design System

The content column is slightly narrower here to accommodate the peripheral elements (share buttons on the left, ToC on the right). This creates a very focused "reading mode" reminiscent of documentation sites like Stripe or Vercel.

## Core Principles

1.  **Readability**: The line length remains optimal.
2.  **Navigation**: Context is always available.
3.  **Sharing**: Social proof is encouraged via the sticky share bar.

## Visual Hierarchy

Even without a hero image, hierarchy is maintained through clear headings and spacing.

### Sub-sections

You can nesting headings deeply, and a robust ToC implementation would track this. For this demo, the ToC links are static, but they demonstrate the visual intent of the theme.

## Typography

We stick to the same Inter font family, but ensuring high contrast for long reading sessions.

## Conclusion

This layout proves that valid design isn't just about pretty pictures—it's about the utility of information.
