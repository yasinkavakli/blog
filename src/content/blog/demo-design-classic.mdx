This is the **Classic** layout. It features a contained hero image that aligns with the content width (or slightly wider), providing a balanced and traditional reading experience.

## Balanced Composition

The classic layout is the workhorse of the web. It is familiar, readable, and effective. The image provides context and visual interest without overwhelming the page.

1. **Title First**: The context is set immediately by the headline.
2. **Visual Anchor**: The image grounds the post.
3. **Content Flow**: The text follows naturally.

### Why choose this?

It works well for almost any type of content, whether it's a tutorial, a personal essay, or a news update. It respects the user's viewport on all devices while maintaining a clear hierarchy.
