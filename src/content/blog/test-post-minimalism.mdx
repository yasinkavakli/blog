# The Art of Minimalist Design

Minimalism is not just about removing elements; it's about adding meaning. In web design, every pixel should serve a purpose.

## Why Minimalism?

This blog focuses on content first. By stripping away distractions, we allow the reader to focus on what truly matters: your words.

### Key Principles

1. **Whitespace**: Give your content room to breathe.
2. **Typography**: Choose fonts that are legible and beautiful.
3. **Contrast**: Use value differences to guide the eye.

> "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

This post uses the **default** layout, optimized for readability with a constrained width.
