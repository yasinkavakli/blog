This is the **Full** layout. The hero image stretches from edge to edge of the browser window (100vw), creating maximum immersion.

## Creating Atmosphere

This layout is excellent for setting a mood. The user is immediately enveloped by the imagery. It works best with high-resolution, atmospheric images that don't have too much critical detail at the very edges (which might be cropped on different aspect ratios).

 > **Note**: The content remains centered and narrow to ensure that the user doesn't have to scan across the entire screen width to read the text.
