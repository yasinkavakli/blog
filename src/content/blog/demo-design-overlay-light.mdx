This post demonstrates the **Overlay Layout** with a light background image. 

In this case, we've set `heroTextColor: "dark"` in the frontmatter to ensure the text remains legible against the brighter background.

## Dynamic Theming

The layout automatically adjusts the gradient overlay and the text color based on your preference. When using a light image:

1.  **Gradient**: Changes from a dark gradient to a subtle light-to-transparent gradient (or background-colored gradient).
2.  **Text**: Primary title and metadata switch to the theme's foreground color instead of white.

## Why this matters

Visual storytelling often requires flexibility. Sometimes your most beautiful image is a bright morning landscape or a clean studio shot. This layout variant ensures you don't have to sacrifice legibility for aesthetics.

### Key Features of this Layout:

*   **Full Screen Impact**: The hero section takes up the full viewport height.
*   **Contextual Legibility**: Optimized text colors for any background.
*   **Seamless Transition**: The transition to the main content remains smooth and consistent.
