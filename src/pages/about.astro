                    Hello! I'm Yasin. I've been building things on the web for
                    over a decade. My journey started with simple HTML/CSS
                    tweaks and evolved into full-stack application development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I currently work at the intersection of design and
                    engineering, ensuring that the products we build are not
                    only functional but also delightful to use. I believe that
                    good design is invisible—it just works.
                </p>

                <h3>Experience</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Senior Engineer</strong> at Tech Corp (2020 - Present)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Product Designer</strong> at Design Studio (2018 -
                        2020)
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Freelance Developer</strong> (2015 - 2018)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Philosophy</h3>
                <p>
                    Simplicity is key. In a world of infinite possibilities,
                    choosing what <em>not</em> to build is just as important as what
                    to build. I strive to create software that respects the user's
                    time and attention.
