                    Hello! I'm Yasin. I spent 30 years living in Vienna before moving
                    out of the city with my wife and our two kids in 2021. I've been
                    building things on the web for over a decade now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My journey started as a C# backend developer. Over time, I made
                    the jump to frontend development and haven't looked back since.
                    These days, I'm excited about exploring agentic coding and the
                    possibilities it unlocks.
                </p>

                <h3>Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    I spent many years working as a C# backend developer before
                    transitioning to the frontend world. These days, I'm focused on
                    building intuitive user experiences while exploring agentic
                    coding and AI-assisted development.
                </p>

                <h3>Currently Exploring</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm fascinated by the idea of AI agents that can help us write
                    better software. The boundary between human and machine
                    creativity is becoming increasingly interesting, and I enjoy
                    experimenting with these new tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not coding, I'm probably spending time with my family—
                    chasing after an 8-year-old boy and a curious 2-year-old girl.
